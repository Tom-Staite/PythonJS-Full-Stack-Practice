# Project Aim

## To provide me with hands on learning and experience with building a full-stack Flask/NodeJS application. As this project is purely for educational purposes, expect to see an abundance of code comments.

### Development Flow
1) Started with basic configuration of the app (config.py).
2) Then went to database (models file) so we can decide what fields, keys, tables, etc that we will need.
3) Then once we know our data, we will proceed with creating routes/views that will modify it (main.py)

### Note on models.py
For this application, the models are all stored within a single Python file. Applications that you build/contribute to are likely to have much larger quantums of models, and so a better appraoch would be to have a models folder with a Python file for each model entity. This would also need a __init__ file to import each model
