# Project Aim

## To provide me with hands on learning and experience with building a full-stack Flask/NodeJS application. As this project is purely for educational purposes, expect to see an abundance of code comments.

### Development Flow
1) Started with basic configuration of the app (config.py).
2) Then went to database (models file) so we can decide what fields, keys, tables, etc that we will need.
3) Then once we know our data, we will proceed with creating routes/views that will modify it (main.py)
